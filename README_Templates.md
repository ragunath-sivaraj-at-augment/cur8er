### 6. Example Workflow

2. AI generates: Christmas-themed background with geometric patterns
3. App overlays:
   - Mosaic logo (blue/orange squares)
   - "MOSAIC" title in proper typography
   - "Real life. Real possibilities." tagline
   - "CHRISTMAS SALE" main message
   - "SHOP NOW" CTA button with website

Result: Professional ad with 100% accurate branding

## Technical Implementation

### Template Configuration
Each template is defined with precise pixel coordinates for:
- Logo placement and sizing
- Text areas with proper fonts
- Color schemes and contrast
- CTA button styling

### AI Prompt Optimization
AI receives optimized prompts like:
```
Create Christmas-themed background design for billboard.
Style: Modern & Minimalist
DO NOT include any text, logos, or company names.
Focus on background patterns, colors, and visual design elements.
Leave designated areas BLANK for text overlay.
```

### Brand Element Application
After AI generation:
1. Resize logo to fit designated area
2. Apply company name with proper typography
3. Add tagline in appropriate font/position
4. Insert main message with high contrast
5. Create CTA button with branding colors

This system ensures your brand elements are always accurate while leveraging AI for creative background design.
