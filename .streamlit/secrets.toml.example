# Example Streamlit secrets configuration
# Copy this file to secrets.toml and add your actual API keys
# This file should be used when deploying to Streamlit Cloud

OPENAI_API_KEY = "your-openai-api-key-here"
GOOGLE_API_KEY = "your-google-api-key-here"  # Used for Imagen, Gemini, and Nano Banana Pro
# NANO_BANANA_API_KEY = "your-nano-banana-api-key-here"  # Optional dedicated key

# IMPORTANT FOR NANO BANANA PRO:
# Nano Banana Pro primarily uses GOOGLE_API_KEY (same as Google Gemini/Imagen)
# Make sure your Google API key has access to generative AI services
